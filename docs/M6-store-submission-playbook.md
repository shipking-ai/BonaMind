# M6 Store Submission — operator playbook

This doc is the single-page checklist for everything you, the maintainer,
must provision *outside* the codebase before the first production cut of
BonaMind. Pair it with the M5 platform hardening + the brand surface
shipped in `lib/branding.ts`.

**Android is the only wired release pipeline.** `mobile-android.yml`
builds and signs the AAB; `deploy.yml` ships the web app to Vercel.
`mobile-ios.yml` builds the iOS app **unsigned** and runs it in a simulator —
there is no signed iOS release or TestFlight job yet. `desktop-windows.yml`
builds the Windows app and drafts a GitHub release on `desktop-v*` tags (see
`DEPLOYMENT.md`); it is not in the Microsoft Store.

Run `node scripts/check-mobile-env.js` (from `bonamind-web/`) to see
which secrets are missing. Items marked **🟠 MUST provision** block the
store upload they name; **🟡 optional** items unlock better UX but a
build still works without them.

## 1. GitHub repo secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions)

All secrets are encrypted at rest and only exposed to jobs that
declare `secrets:` access. None of these values should land in this
repo, in commit history, or in a notes tool.

### Wired today

These are consumed by workflows that exist in `.github/workflows/`.

| Secret                               | Used by            | Required for |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| 🟠 `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_B64`            | mobile-android.yml | Android release keystore (base64) |
| 🟠 `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`       | mobile-android.yml | Android keystore password |
| 🟠 `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`               | mobile-android.yml | Android key alias (e.g. `auramind-upload`) |
| 🟠 `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`            | mobile-android.yml | Android key password |
| 🟠 `PLAY_STORE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | mobile-android.yml | Google Play API service-account JSON |
| 🟠 `VERCEL_TOKEN`                    | deploy.yml         | Web deploy to Vercel |
| 🟠 `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | deploy.yml | Client Supabase config (public) |
| 🟠 `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`   | migration-drift.yml | Server-side schema checks |
| 🟠 `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`     | deploy.yml, mobile-*.yml | Client Stripe config (public) |
| 🟡 `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY`                | mobile-android.yml | Product analytics in the Android build (the web build reads it from Vercel env) |

Generate the Android release keystore first. **The backup is
irreplaceable**: losing the keystore means you cannot upload updates to
the existing Play listing. Keep two offline copies.

No Apple secrets are needed yet: the iOS workflow builds unsigned. Signing
and TestFlight need an Apple Developer Program membership first (see
`HANDOFF.md`).

## 2. Google Play Console

### 2.1 Create the app record

1. https://play.google.com/console → All apps → Create app.
2. App name: BonaMind
3. Default language: English (United States)
4. App or game → App
5. Free or paid: Free

### 2.2 Service-account JSON for API uploads

1. Google Cloud Console → IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → Create.
2. Grant the "Service Account User" role on the **Play Internal Apps
   Admin** (or the new release-management role once migrated).
3. Create a JSON key. Download + store in a password manager.
4. In Play Console → Setup → API access → Link the service account.

### 2.3 First track upload (internal testing → production)

`store/android/changelogs/en-US.txt` is the changelog fed to
`fastlane supply` on every `r0adkll/upload-google-play` invocation.
The circle of trust:

1. Build → push to **internal testing** track.
2. Roll out to internal testers. Verify end-to-end against the Maven
   crash + the AI deck flow.
3. Promote internal → closed beta → production with 10% → 50% → 100%
   staged rollout.

### 2.4 Play Store listing fields

`store/android/listings/en-US/full_description.txt` syncs on every CI
build. The values map (Play → mint → asciidoc):

- **App name**: 30 char cap, exact "BonaMind"
- **Short description**: 80 char cap
- **Full description**: 4000 char cap
- **App icon**: 512×512 PNG (also auto-generates adaptive from supplied
  foreground/background)
- **Feature graphic**: 1024×500 PNG
- **Screenshots**: 2–8 phone (320–3840px), 2–8 tablet (7"+ and 10"+)

## 3. Pre-flight check (everything in one place)

From `bonamind-web/scripts/check-mobile-env.js`:

```bash
# Android only (cheapest minimal check):
node scripts/check-mobile-env.js

# Android + Play Store upload:
node scripts/check-mobile-env.js --with-play

```

The script never prints secret values. It verifies file-existence and
plausible shape (length, prefix, JSON marker) and exits 0 when all
required items are present.

## 4. Routine cadence after launch

| Action                                           | Cadence      |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Upload a maintenance AAB to Play Internal         | Every release |
| Verify the Play listing still renders correctly   | Per release  |
| Rotate the Play service-account key               | Annually     |
| Regenerate supabase JWT signing keys              | Quarterly    |
