# Changelog

All notable changes to BonaMind will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.3] - 2026-10-18

### Fixed
- **Windows app: Quick Review** - opening it froze the whole app (the
  panel was built on the thread WebView2 needs to finish it), and once
  that was fixed it showed an old "Page not found": the panel loaded from
  http://tauri.localhost instead of the main window's https origin, so it
  had no sign-in and an old service worker served a stale app

## [2.3.2] - 2026-10-18

### Fixed
- **Windows app** - when another app already owns the Quick Review
  shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+Space), Settings now says so and asks for another,
  instead of showing a shortcut that does nothing
- **Windows app** - the window title on launch says "Today · BonaMind"
  rather than "BonaMind"

## [2.3.1] - 2026-10-18

### Fixed
- **Windows app, light mode** - the Quick Review shortcut, its Change
  button and the Start with Windows switch in Settings, and the selected
  Study Coach / Companion pill in Prof. Linnea, were nearly invisible
- **Windows app** - the Library says "1 card due", and the window title on
  Today says "Today"

## [2.3.0] - 2026-10-18

### Changed
- **Windows app look** - paper and ink instead of generic cards: a command
  bar, plain lists with columns and a status bar; warm paper (light) and a
  warm desk (dark); serif headlines; study sessions on a ruled index card
  with the answer in handwriting. The title bar matches the app's theme

## [2.2.0] - 2026-10-16

### Added
- **Windows app: its own simple layout** - a Windows 11-style sidebar
  (Today, Library, Create, Prof. Linnea, Settings) that collapses with ☰ or
  Ctrl+B; a Today screen with what's due and one Start review button; a
  searchable Library with a right-click menu; study sessions inside the
  window driven by the keyboard (Space, 1–4, Esc); and the app, window and
  title bar following Windows light or dark mode

### Changed
- **Windows app** uses the normal Windows mouse pointer instead of the
  website's custom cursor

## [2.1.0] - 2026-10-16

### BonaMind rename

- **AuraMind is now BonaMind, and Prof. Aura is now Prof. Linnea** - on <!-- legacy-name: ok -->
  every screen, notification, store listing and doc, across the website,
  Android, Wear OS, iOS and Windows apps
- **Saved data moves with you** - settings, reminders, XP, streaks,
  achievements, consent choices, queued offline reviews and placed widgets
  and watch tiles carry over to the new names on first launch; nothing is
  deleted
- **New `bonamind://` links** - every app now sends `bonamind://` links, and
  older links still open the app
- **Permanent names stay** - the app ID `com.auramind.app` and a few stored
  names are kept on purpose so installs, updates and settings survive (see
  `scripts/check-brand.mjs`)
- **Brand guard in CI** - `scripts/check-brand.mjs` fails a PR that brings
  an old name back outside its allow-list

### Added
- **Community tab in the Library** - browse decks other learners published
  (search, category, popular/newest) and add one to your library. Adding
  forks the deck on the server, so the copy and its cards are yours. Shows a
  real empty state instead of the hard-coded demo decks the old browse code
  fell back to
- **Windows app** - a new Tauri 2 desktop app around the bundled web build:
  its own window that remembers its size, one instance at a time, outside
  links (including checkout) opening in the browser, and signed auto-updates
  from GitHub Releases with an in-app "Restart and update" prompt. Replaces
  the retired June desktop build
- **Windows app, full desktop integration** - tray with the due count,
  taskbar badge, study reminders as Windows notifications with Quick
  review / Later, a Quick Review corner window on Ctrl+Alt+Space, drag a
  file onto the window (or right-click it in Explorer) to make a course,
  `bonamind://` links, a navy Windows 11 title bar and no white flash on
  launch
- **Classroom portal** - teachers create classes, students join with a
  6-character code or deep link, and teachers assign decks and
  multiple-choice quizzes graded on the server, with per-student progress
  and most-missed terms. Every write goes through a SECURITY DEFINER RPC
- **Memory sparks** - cards that are fading (not yet forgotten) resurface
  as in-app pop-ups, native notifications, and cards mixed into study
  sessions, all driven by one FSRS-based scheduler
- **Onboarding flow** - role and topic, with a starter deck created before
  the paywall so the library is never empty
- **Tester role** - an internal QA role that skips the paywall with no
  staff powers
- **Unified admin hub** - every `/admin/*` page in the dashboard shell, a new
  Overview and Settings page, a working notification panel, and review
  charts built from real `card_reviews` history
- **Push sender** - FCM HTTP v1 sender, admin `POST /api/push/send`, and a
  daily due-card reminder; dormant until Firebase credentials are set
- **Voice on Android** - read-aloud and spoken-answer listening through
  native plugins (the WebView has no Web Speech API), spoken reminders,
  and natural AI voices with the device voice as fallback
- **iOS app** - Capacitor 8 project built unsigned in CI, with an
  iOS-native design, Prof. Linnea chat (Talk / Notebook / Cards), the study
  session as a Live Activity, and Siri / Shortcuts ("quiz me", "what's
  due"). A public sample-data preview builds with `npm run build:ios-preview`
- **Android 16 Live Update** for study sessions, plus launcher shortcuts,
  a Quick Settings tile, deck pinning, and a Material shell
- **Desktop web extras** - Study Float (an always-on-top review window),
  a Windows 11 widget board widget, and on-device key-idea / translation
  with Chrome's built-in AI
- **Scroll-reactive aurora** - depth parallax and hue drift on the
  dashboard, landing hero, and Android aura; off under reduced motion
- **"Accept only necessary"** option on the cookie banner
- **Admin bulk email** - the endpoint now sends through Resend with
  per-recipient `{sent, failed}` accounting instead of logging and
  reporting a fake success
- **Cookie-consent banner** - one-time, non-blocking; analytics init
  skips until Accept, Decline keeps it off, legacy Settings opt-outs
  are honored silently

### Changed
- **Scheduler is now the official `ts-fsrs` (FSRS-6)** - see Fixed.
  Per-user FSRS tuning is ignored until it is rebuilt for FSRS-6
- **Employees get free access in the app** - the server already let them use
  AI for free while the UI showed them the paywall; both now agree, and a
  test fails if the client and server role lists drift
- **CI runs on Node 22 and 24**; Node 20 (end of life) was dropped
- Reminders sync at app start as well as from Settings
- Turnstile is disabled and OAuth buttons hidden inside the native apps
- Unused files, routes and dependencies removed, including the legacy
  unentitled chat endpoint and the learning-paths feature

### Fixed
- **Forking a marketplace deck always failed** - it selected a `cards.image`
  column that doesn't exist, and would have copied zero cards anyway (RLS
  hides other users' cards from the client). Forking is now one server-side
  RPC, and `fork_count` can no longer be bumped without actually forking
- **Download page offered installers that don't exist** - the macOS and
  Linux buttons 404'd and the Windows one served an unmaintained June build
  of the removed Tauri app. The page now explains installing the web app
  from the browser, shows Android as in closed testing, and no longer
  publishes the internal store-submission checklist
- **FSRS intervals were ~140x too long** - the hand-written scheduler
  mis-mapped grades, so "Hard" could schedule a card 100 years out. Replaced
  with `ts-fsrs`; a migration reset the schedules it had written
- **Weekly league XP double-counted** - now added once, written only through
  the `increment_weekly_xp` RPC
- **Memory sparks** ignored the global gap between sparks, and re-plans
  used up the daily cap
- **Review ratings of 5 rejected** - `record_card_review` still capped
  at 0..4 after the table went 0..5; Easy/perfect-recall reviews 22000'd
- **Session replay lost re-graded cards** - `card_reviews` kept one row
  per card, so a later re-grade moved the row out of the earlier
  session's time window; the table now stores one row per review with
  a `(user_id, card_id, reviewed_at)` idempotency key for offline retry
- **Payment-success email showed no billing date** - it read
  `invoice.next_payment_attempt`, null on success; now uses the
  subscription's `current_period_end`
- **Undeclared `zod` dependency** - imported by the API but only present
  via lockfile residue and local hoisting; CI's clean install failed.
  Now declared at the last locked 3.22.4
- **E2E auth tests hung on `networkidle`** - Turnstile holds a
  challenges.cloudflare.com connection open; those tests wait on
  `domcontentloaded` plus locator assertions instead

### Security
- **Cross-user card injection** - `cards` had two permissive policies per
  command that OR'd together, so a user could insert or move their own card
  into another user's deck (where the owner would then see and study it),
  and a deck owner could reassign a card to another user. Every command now
  requires both card and deck ownership. The same migration drops leftover
  public league policies that let signed-out visitors list every user id
  and weekly XP
- **Admin user list and export trusted `user_metadata`** - role and plan
  were read from fields any user can set, so a free account could appear to
  staff as an admin on Pro. Both now come from `app_metadata`. The CSV
  export also escapes cells and neutralises leading `=`/`+`/`-`/`@`, so a
  user-chosen name can no longer run as a spreadsheet formula
- **Admin oracle closed** - any signed-in user could call `is_admin(uuid)` /
  `is_super_admin(uuid)` to learn whether an account was an admin. Client
  EXECUTE revoked; the `audit_events` policy uses `current_user_is_admin()`
- **Client role came from `user_metadata`** - one `auth.updateUser` call
  could set `role: 'admin'` and unlock the paywall in the UI. Roles now come
  from `app_metadata` only, on client and server alike
- **Metadata wiped on billing events** - `updateUserById` replaces
  `app_metadata` wholesale, so a purchase or dunning event could demote
  staff. Every call site now merges the existing metadata
- **Classroom writes are RPC-only**, and a student can no longer copy
  another user's private deck through an assignment
- **Production dependency audit is clean** in the app, API, and root
- **`fetch-url` / `fetch-youtube-transcript` required no auth** - open
  fetch-and-parse proxy behind only IP rate limiting; both now require
  the session bearer token, which the generator screens send
- **Transcription skipped entitlement** - any signed-in free account
  could spend server Whisper budget; now gated like chat (402)
- **Realtime-notify edge function authenticated** - previously broadcast
  any payload to any user's channel; fail-closed shared secret, and 11
  unused legacy edge functions (open Groq proxy, open email relay,
  hard-coded test secret) deleted

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-09

First release published to Google Play (closed testing). Android ships from
the same React source via Capacitor 8.

### Added
- **FSRS v5** - replaced SM-2 with the Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler
- **AI provider failover** - Groq -> Cerebras -> Gemini -> OpenRouter, all
  OpenAI-shaped, so a spent free tier degrades to another free tier instead of
  an outage. A 4xx that would fail identically everywhere does not fail over
- **Puter.js fallback** - user-pays in-browser AI offered when every server
  provider is rate limited
- **AI fact-checking**, **Anki export**, **offline study** (IndexedDB with a
  sync queue), **PWA install**, **data export**, **cookie consent**
- **Cloudflare Turnstile** on captcha-gated Supabase auth calls
- **Android home-screen widget** - 2x2 RemoteViews showing cards due, fed by
  the web layer through Capacitor Preferences so FSRS stays in one place
- **Editorial design system for Android** - a token layer over the platform
  styles: a real mobile type scale, three radii, one hairline, and a full-bleed
  hero. Replaces a look assembled from ad-hoc values
- **Haptics on the study loop** - the card flip and session completion, which
  had none, alongside the existing rating feedback
- **Press feedback** - controls dip on touch, behind prefers-reduced-motion
- **3D card flip** - a shell rotates the card while the tilt continues
  underneath, replacing a crossfade
- **SEO** - Open Graph, Twitter Cards and JSON-LD structured data
- **Loading skeletons** and a custom 404 page
- **Environment validation** - fail fast on missing required variables
- **Security headers** - CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options

### Changed
- **Entitlement moved to `app_metadata`** - see Security
- **Reminders sync at app start**, not only while the Settings screen is open,
  so a schedule can be repaired without visiting Settings
- **Service worker no longer runs on native** - see Fixed
- **Streak derived from `study_sessions`** rather than a profile column
- **Android release pipeline** - versionCode from CI run number, closed-track
  uploads, and a release status input (draft until the first publish)
- Socratic tutoring - Prof. Aura guides toward an answer rather than stating it
- Header avatar shows the account picture rather than initials
- The signed-in email is masked in Settings, revealed on tap

### Fixed
- **Rate limiting never applied.** `applyMiddleware` was called without
  `await`, so every request proceeded before the limiter resolved
- **Daily reminders fired once and never again.** Capacitor treats an `on`
  pattern as one-shot unless `repeats` is set; the OS held every reminder with
  `repeats: false`
- **Service worker served the previous release's JavaScript.** Capacitor's
  origin never changes, so a registered worker survives app updates and
  answered navigations from its own precache. Assets already ship in the APK,
  so the precache could only ever serve an older copy of a local file
- **Two loading screens on launch** - the splash now holds until the app can
  render instead of handing off to a second, differently-styled loader
- **Android AI calls resolved against the device** rather than the API host
- **`card_analytics` leaked every user's cards** - the view ran as its owner
- Chat header overflowed the viewport on 412px phones; section headings
  collided with their subtitles; tap targets below 40px
- CSP blocked the Google Fonts stylesheet and the PostHog scripts

### Security
- **Paywall bypass.** `subscription_status` lived in `user_metadata`, which a
  signed-in user can write directly, so any account could grant itself a
  permanent subscription. Entitlement now reads `app_metadata`, writable only
  with the service-role key, with no fallback
- **Client bundle published every `VITE_` variable.** A dynamic
  `import.meta.env[name]` lookup defeats Vite's per-variable substitution and
  inlines the whole env object. Reads now go through a static allowlist
- `anon` could execute all 18 SECURITY DEFINER functions over PostgREST
- `search_path` pinned on public functions
- Turnstile added to auth
