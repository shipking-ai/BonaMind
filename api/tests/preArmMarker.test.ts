/**
 * The pre-arm marker outlived the thing it was describing.
 *
 * `stripe/checkout` stamps `trial_armed_at` so an abandoned tab cannot hold
 * paid access forever, and the webhook is what corrects it once money moves.
 * But every webhook handler built its patch by hand:
 *
 *     app_metadata: {
 *       ...(existing?.user?.app_metadata || {}),
 *       subscription_status: subscription.status,
 *     }
 *
 * updateUserById replaces metadata wholesale, so the spread was needed to keep
 * `role`. The side effect was that `trial_armed_at` came along for the ride.
 * The reader treats `trialing` + marker as an expiring pre-arm, so a customer
 * who did complete checkout was indistinguishable from one who abandoned it:
 *
 *     POST /api/stripe/checkout   -> 'trialing' + trial_armed_at
 *     pay, Stripe fires the webhook -> 'trialing' + trial_armed_at (carried over)
 *     ... PREARM_WINDOW_DAYS later -> 'expired', real customer locked out
 *
 * The comment above `readSubscriptionStatus` claimed real Stripe trials have no
 * marker. That was true of the webhook in isolation and false once the record
 * was spread forward, which is exactly why this went unnoticed.
 *
 * `entitlementPatch` now owns the rule and drops the marker, and all five
 * webhook sites route through it. These tests pin the sequence rather than the
 * helper, so re-introducing a raw spread in the webhook cannot pass.
