/**
 * Entitlement: the single place that decides whether a user has paid access.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — this is a security boundary, not a convenience wrapper.
 *
 * Subscription status used to live in `user_metadata`, which Supabase lets a
 * signed-in user write directly:
 *
 *     await supabase.auth.updateUser({ data: { subscription_status: 'active' } })
 *
 * The Stripe webhook wrote it there and /api/subscription read it back, so the
 * server was treating a client-writable field as the source of truth for
 * billing. Any account could grant itself a permanent free subscription with
 * one line. CLAUDE.md already states the rule for admin roles — "never trust
 * user_metadata for authorization" — and billing needs the same treatment.
 *
 * `app_metadata` is only writable with the service-role key, which never
 * leaves the server. That makes it the correct home for the authorization
 * decision.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NO FALLBACK to user_metadata. A fallback would reintroduce the
 * whole bug: an attacker sets user_metadata on an account that has no
 * app_metadata entry, the read falls through, and they are entitled again.
 * Existing users are backfilled by
 * supabase/migrations/20260907000020_move_entitlement_to_app_metadata.sql,
 * which must be applied BEFORE this code ships — after the backfill, an
 * absent app_metadata entry correctly means "never subscribed".
 *
 * Display-only fields (plan name, trial_end, payment_failure_count) stay in
 * user_metadata. Tampering with those changes what a user sees, not what they
 * can do, so they are not worth the migration risk.

 * mid-trial exactly one `PREARM_WINDOW_DAYS` after arming.
 *
 * Dropping it is also what makes the "a real Stripe trial has no marker"
 * comment above true. Spreading the previous record silently carried the
 * marker forward, so the two states were indistinguishable to the reader.

 * replaced, and so a re-subscribe after a cancellation does not inherit a
