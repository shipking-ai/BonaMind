/**
 * Canonical app origin and email sender — the single source of truth for
 * everything in the API that needs to know "where does this app live".
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * The domain was hardcoded in five places that had to change together, and
 * two of them failed silently rather than loudly:
 *
 *   _middleware.ts CORS allowlist   a request from a new domain gets NO
 *                                   Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, which
 *                                   the browser surfaces as a generic network
 *                                   failure. This is the "login just spins"
 *                                   bug.
 *   stripe-webhook.ts email links   every receipt and dunning email links to
 *                                   the old /dashboard and /subscribe, so
 *                                   customers land on a page that 404s or,
 *                                   worse, keeps billing on the old domain.
 *
 * A rename touches both, so they belong in one file.
 *
 * Relationship to app-identity.ts
 * -------------------------------
 * `bonamind-web/app-identity.ts` owns the product NAME (what users read).
 * This file owns the DOMAIN (where the app is served) and is consumed by the
 * serverless API, which cannot import from the web app's TypeScript. Two
 * constants, two runtimes, one place each.
 *
 * Environment
 * -----------
 * APP_ORIGIN overrides the default. Set it when the domain changes — it is
 * also what the CORS allowlist derives its web origins from, so setting it in
 * one env var updates auth, API access, and email links together.
 *
 * LEGACY_APP_ORIGIN additionally allowlists the previous domain during a
 * migration; see its own comment.

 * listing. If those origins stopped being recognised the moment the default
 * changed, a customer following a link from a receipt they kept would get a
 * silent network failure rather than a page.
 *
 * Empty when APP_ORIGIN is already auramind.app, so a deployment that has not // legacy-name: ok
 * migrated does not end up allowlisting its own origin twice. Remove this once
