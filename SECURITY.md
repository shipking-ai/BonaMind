# Security Policy

Thanks for helping keep BonaMind users safe. We take vulnerability
reports seriously and respond within the SLAs below.

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported           |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| latest  | ✅ Active support   |
| previous minor | ✅ Security-only patches |
| anything older than two minor versions | ❌ End-of-life |

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do NOT file a public GitHub issue for security bugs.**

Open a **GitHub Security Advisory** privately:

[https://github.com/shipking-ai/BonaMind-App-2/security/advisories/new](https://github.com/shipking-ai/BonaMind-App-2/security/advisories/new)

Include:
- a clear description of the vulnerability and the impact you observed
- reproduction steps (or a screencast / curl transcript)
- the SHA or release tag you reproduced against
- whether you are OK with being credited in the fix announcement

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories (e.g. you are reporting
from an account GitHub does not recognize), email **security@bonamind.app**
with the same payload. The on-call maintainer reads this inbox daily.

## Our response SLA

| Stage                       | Target          |
| --------------------------- | --------------- |
| Acknowledge report          | within 48 hours |
| Initial triage & severity   | within 7 days   |
| Patch for Critical / High   | within 30 days  |
| Patch for Medium            | within 90 days  |
| Patch for Low / informational | best-effort   |

We will keep you informed of progress and credit you in the release
notes unless you ask to remain anonymous.

## Hardening commitments the project already follows

These are the rules every PR must respect — if you find drift, please
flag it:

- Authorization (roles, admin, subscription status) is read from
  `app_metadata` only. `user_metadata` is writable by the signed-in user
  and is never trusted.
- No provider or server key is ever `VITE_`-prefixed; client env reads go
  through the `CLIENT_ENV` allowlist (enforced by
  `src/__tests__/clientSecretExposure.test.ts`).
- SECURITY DEFINER functions pin `search_path`, `REVOKE EXECUTE` from
  `PUBLIC, anon`, and guard themselves with `auth.uid()`.
- Every new `UPDATE` RLS policy carries a `WITH CHECK` clause.
- No `FOR INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE` policy may be named ending in `(dev)`.
- New tables get at most one permissive policy per `(cmd, table)` pair,
  scoped `TO authenticated` unless anonymous access is intended.
- `.env*` and any `*keystore*/*credentials*` files are `.gitignore`d;
  their absence from the repo is by design.
- Supabase migration files are append-only and idempotent (`ADD COLUMN
  IF NOT EXISTS`, `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS`, etc.).

### Known drift in the live database (checked 2026-09-29)

The last three rules are not yet true of every table. Policies created
before the migrations became the source of truth still exist in the live
project.

**Fixed by `20260929_cards_rls_owner_and_deck.sql`** (apply it with
`npm run migrate` after merge):

- `cards` had two permissive policies per command ("own cards" and "cards
  in own decks"). They OR together, so a user could write their own card
  into another user's deck, and a deck owner could reassign a card to
  another user. Every command now requires card **and** deck ownership.
- Duplicate SELECT policies on `decks`, `league_memberships` and
  `league_seasons` (the leftover `league_*` ones also let `anon` list every
  user id and weekly XP), and `UPDATE` without explicit `WITH CHECK` on
  `decks` and `study_sessions`.

**Still open — legacy tables the app does not read:**

- Duplicate policies on `profiles`, `shared_decks`, `stripe_*`,
  `email_preferences`, and a few log tables. Most pair a user's own-row
  read with an admin read, which is intended; the `profiles` ones are not.
- `UPDATE` without explicit `WITH CHECK` on `learning_path_enrollments`
  and `profiles`. Postgres falls back to the `USING` expression, so this is
  hygiene, not an open write.
- `profiles` has a `USING (true)` SELECT policy. It is not reachable from
  the client — `anon` and `authenticated` hold no grant on it — and it is
  empty; the app uses `user_profiles`. Dropping these tables is the real
  fix.

Don't copy their pattern.

## Dependency audit status (Sep 28, 2026)

`npm audit --omit=dev` reports **0 vulnerabilities** in all three
packages (`bonamind-web/`, `api/`, and the repo root). The residuals
listed in the August audit (js-yaml, ws/engine.io-client via puter.js,
react-router 6.x) are resolved.

The weekly `scheduled-checks.yml` run gates at **critical** severity.
Re-run the audit after any major dependency upgrade.

## Recognition

We follow a coordinated disclosure model. Public disclosure of an
issue should wait until either a patch ships or 90 days have elapsed
from the report — whichever comes first.
