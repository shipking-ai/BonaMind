 * retention efficiency by modeling the forgetting curve with optimized parameters.
 *
 * Backward compatibility: Existing cards using SM-2 values are automatically
 * converted to FSRS state on first review.
 *
 * weightsOverride is an optional per-user tuned weight vector produced by
 * loadPersonalizedFsrs in ./fsrsAdaptation. When omitted the global defaults
 * are used and behaviour is identical to the previous single-arg form.
