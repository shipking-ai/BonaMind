/**
 * FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) — scheduling for every review.
 *
 * The math is the official implementation, `ts-fsrs` (FSRS-6), used in
 * long-term mode: intervals are whole days, matching the `cards.interval`
 * INTEGER column, and "Again" brings a card back the next day.
 *
 * Why not our own formulas any more: the previous hand-written version
 * mis-mapped grades and used a weight as the forgetting-curve factor, which
 * made intervals ~140x too long: "Hard" could schedule a card 100 years out
 * and "Good" several years. Tests pin the corrected behaviour.
 *
 * Key concepts:
 * - Stability (S): days until recall probability falls to 90%
 * - Difficulty (D): 1-10, how hard the card is for this learner
 * - Retrievability (R): probability of recall right now
 * - Target retention: the recall probability reviews are scheduled at
 *
 * Reference: https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/ts-fsrs
