/**
 * Creates a deck from a user's onboarding topic.
 *
 * Tries the AI deck generator first (Groq with the offline template as a
 * fallback), so a new user gets cards on the thing they actually typed at
 * onboarding. Degrades to the offline starter deck when AI is entirely
 * unavailable, keeping the "pre-made cards wait for you" promise true even
 * offline.
 *
 * Cards go through `getInitialCardState` exactly like every other deck, so
 * the first review enters FSRS in the same due-now state as any generated
 * deck.
