/**
 * cardReviewsService — write-side companion to `useSessionReplay`.
 *
 * Background.
 *   Until M6.5, only `offlineStudyService.syncOfflineData` inserted rows into
 *   the `card_reviews` table — meaning any 100% online study session left
 *   `card_reviews` empty and `SessionReplayModal` rendered an empty state.
 *   M6.5 wired StudyModePage → this service → Supabase upsert; it then 403'd
 *   in production because:
 *
 *   (a) the table's INSERT policy was `WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id)`,
 *       which spammed 42501 whenever the reviewer wrote a card they had
 *       ALREADY rated (the UPSERT ON CONFLICT leg routes through UPDATE);
 *   (b) the table's UPDATE policy was bounded to `reviewed_at > NOW() -
 *       INTERVAL '1 hour'`, so any re-grade after the first hour was a
 *       guaranteed 42501 with no UI feedback.
 *
 * M7 (this file) replaces the REST upsert with a single RPC call,
 * `record_card_review(...)`, which:
 *
 *     - validates caller ownership of both the card and the review row;
 *     - performs the write under SECURITY DEFINER;
 *     - permits re-grading at any latency (the 1-hour UPDATE window is gone).
 *
 * Each review inserts its own `card_reviews` row (history, not latest-only),
 * so SessionReplayModal sees per-session rows; offline re-flush stays
 * idempotent via the (user_id, card_id, reviewed_at) key because the queue
 * replays the original review timestamp.
 *
 * The shape on the wire and the error class are unchanged so the
 * StudyModePage + FlowMode catch chains stay the same.

/**

 * the UI shows on this error is actionable — "rating out of range, this
 * session will be replayed correctly on next sync" — instead of the
 * previous red-error spam that panicked users.
 *
 * With M7's RPC, `code` will usually be `42501` (auth mismatch surfaced by
 * the SECURITY DEFINER function) or `P0002` (card not found). UX-wise the
 * callers treat both as "log and continue" — the FP toast is only triggered
 * for the legacy 23514/22P02 path that should never occur through the RPC.
