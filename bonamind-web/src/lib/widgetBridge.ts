/**
 * Feeds the Android home-screen widget.
 *
 * The widget is a plain RemoteViews AppWidget (see
 * android/app/src/main/java/com/auramind/app/BonaMindWidgetProvider.java). It
 * cannot call into the web layer, so the contract is deliberately dumb: this
 * writes two strings into Capacitor Preferences — which is SharedNames
 * "CapacitorStorage" underneath — and the provider reads them when it redraws.
 *
 * Keeping the count on this side matters. Due-ness is an FSRS question the
 * TypeScript already answers everywhere else; reimplementing that scheduling
 * in Java would give the widget its own subtly different idea of "due" and
 * guarantee the two drift apart.
 *
 * The redraw is triggered by MainActivity.onPause, not from here: a widget is
 * only looked at after leaving the app, so refreshing on the way out is both
 * the right moment and one less bridge call.
