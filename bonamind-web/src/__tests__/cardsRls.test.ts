/**
 * cardsRls.test.ts — pins the cards RLS consolidation without a live database.
 *
 * cards used to carry two permissive policies per command ("own cards" and
 * "cards in own decks"). Permissive policies OR together, so a user could
 * write their own card into someone else's deck, and a deck owner could hand
 * a card to another user. 20260929_cards_rls_owner_and_deck requires BOTH
 * card ownership and deck ownership on every command.
 *
 * This replays CREATE/DROP POLICY across supabase/migrations/*.sql in
 * filename order and asserts the effective policy set, so a later migration
 * that re-adds a one-sided cards policy fails CI. The legacy policies were
 * created outside the migrations (base schema), so the test also checks the
 * consolidation migration drops every one of them by its live name.
 *
 * Same file-analysis pattern as adminOracle.test.ts.
