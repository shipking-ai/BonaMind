/**
 * TrustStrip — three claims about the product, all substantiable.
 *
 * This previously animated three hardcoded user metrics: 1,248 active
 * learners, 84,000 cards reviewed, 91% average retention. BonaMind has not
 * launched, so all three were fabricated, and the first sat directly below
 * a "Join 1,248 learners" line — the same invented number twice.
 *
 * Beyond being untrue, invented metrics are the specific claim type the FTC
 * treats as requiring substantiation, and they are trivially disproved by
 * anyone who checks. They are replaced here with facts about the software
 * that can be verified from the codebase:
 *
 *   - FSRS v5 is the scheduler (services/study/fsrs.ts).
 *   - 90% is `requestRetention` in DEFAULT_CONFIG — what the scheduler
 *     optimises for. It is a statement about configuration, not a claim
 *     about what users have achieved.
 *   - Hands-free voice study is implemented and shipping.
 *
 * Swap these back to live numbers once real usage exists; read them from
 * Supabase rather than hardcoding, so they can never drift into fiction.
