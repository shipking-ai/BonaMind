/**
 * Capacitor configuration for the BonaMind Android and iOS apps.
 *
 * - appId is fixed forever: `com.auramind.app`. Changing it after the first
 *   Play Store upload makes the store treat the app as a brand-new package,
 *   orphaning the listing, every tester install link, and the closed-testing
 *   clock. It is intentionally NOT part of app-identity.ts for that reason.
 * - appName comes from app-identity.ts, the single source of truth for the
 *   product name. Change the name there, not here.
 * - webDir points at the Vite production build output (`npm run build`).
 * - Traffic is HTTPS-only via the `https` androidScheme; cleartext is NOT
 *   enabled so release builds reject plain HTTP.
