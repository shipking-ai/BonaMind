# BonaMind — Google Play Store Listing

> **v1 copy approved for upload directly into the Play Console.** Brand: BonaMind.
> No parent-company name appears in the listing — CogniVect, Inc. is being
> dissolved (see the FROZEN block in `src/lib/branding.ts`), so there is nothing
> to attribute the listing to and nothing to declare as developer.
>
> The store's **"Developer/Vendor Name" and contact fields still need updating**
> in the Play Console — those are console settings, not files, and they must match
> whatever entity is confirmed as the operator. See `store/PRE_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`.

Stop cramming. Start retaining.

BonaMind uses FSRS — the modern spaced-repetition algorithm shown to retain 30% more per study session than legacy Anki-style schedulers — to schedule the right card at the right moment, every time.

WHAT YOU GET

• AI-generated flashcards — drop a PDF, a video link, or a topic; BonaMind turns it into a deck in under a minute.
• Personalized spaced repetition — the algorithm learns YOUR memory and reshapes its schedule around it. The longer you use BonaMind, the faster you remember.
• Active recall + retrieval practice — proven to outperform re-reading by 2-3x.
• Offline-first — all your decks live on your device; sync when you're back online.
• Streaks, leagues, and friends — gentle pressure to keep your study habit alive, but never burn-out inducing.
• Memory Palace + Flow Mode — turn your hardest topic into a visual walkthrough or enter distraction-free deep-study mode.
• Concept Maps — see how ideas in a deck connect to each other.

PRIVACY-FIRST

Your decks and notes stay on your device. We don't sell your study data. We use post-hoc analytics (PostHog) only for product improvement, and Sentry only for crash reports. The full privacy policy is at https://bonamind.app/privacy.

BUILT FOR STUDENTS WHO ACTUALLY STUDY

Whether you're prepping for med school (USMLE), law school (BAR), grad school cumulative exams, or learning a new language — BonaMind adapts to whatever you're mastering.
